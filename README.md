# CodeSync: AI-Powered Code Analysis Tool

## Overview

CodeSync is an advanced Python-based code analysis and optimization tool that provides comprehensive insights into code quality, performance, and potential improvements. Leveraging AI-powered techniques, CodeSync helps developers identify code smells, security vulnerabilities, and optimization opportunities across their projects.

## Features

### üîç Advanced Code Analysis
- Detect code complexity
- Identify potential security risks
- Analyze performance bottlenecks
- Check Python best practices

### üìä Project Health Reporting
- Track code quality over time
- Generate detailed project health reports
- Highlight critical files
- Calculate severity scores

### üíæ Persistent Repository Management
- Create and manage multiple code repositories
- Persistent storage of code reviews
- Interactive CLI for easy management

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Standard Python libraries (included in the script)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have Python installed
3. Run the script directly

```bash
python codesync.py
```

## Usage

### Interactive CLI Menu
When you run the script, you'll be presented with an interactive menu:

1. **Create Repository**: Add a new code repository for analysis
2. **List Repositories**: View all managed repositories
3. **Analyze Repository**: Perform comprehensive code analysis
4. **View Project Health Report**: Get insights into your project's code quality
5. **Remove Repository**: Remove a repository from management
6. **Exit**: Close the application

### Example Workflow
1. Create a repository by providing a name and path
2. Analyze the repository to get detailed code insights
3. Review the project health report to identify areas of improvement
